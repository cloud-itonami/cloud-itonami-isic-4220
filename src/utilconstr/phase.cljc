  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the utility-line-construction-coordination
  analog of `construction.phase`/`demolition.phase`/`roadrail.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only              -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-logging       -- `:log-site-record` allowed, every
                                       write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination  -- adds `:flag-safety-concern` and
                                       `:order-supplies` writes, still
                                       approval.
    Phase 3  supervised-coordination -- adds `:schedule-construction-
                                       operation`; governor-clean,
                                       high-confidence `:log-site-record`
                                       (pure data logging, no capital/
                                       safety risk) AND `:order-supplies`
                                       BELOW the cost threshold may
                                       auto-commit.

  ## Actuation (there is none -- read this before changing this file)

  This actor performs NO real-world actuation. Every proposal it can ever
  produce carries `:effect :propose` (see `utilconstr.governor` ns
  docstring checks 1-4) -- 'committing' a proposal here means only that a
  coordination artifact (a site-record-log entry, a schedule PROPOSAL, a
  safety-concern flag, a supply-order PROPOSAL) is now logged in the SSoT
  + audit ledger. It never dispatches heavy equipment, never finalizes a
  utility-tie-in or energization-authorization decision -- that authority
  is the licensed utility engineer / site supervisor's exclusively.

  `:schedule-construction-operation` and `:flag-safety-concern` are
  DELIBERATELY ABSENT from every phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3
  -- a permanent structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to come.
  Proposing a trenching/pipe-laying/tie-in-crew schedule window
  coordinates potential heavy-equipment dispatch near public traffic and
  OTHER buried utilities, and surfacing a utility-strike/excavation-
  collapse/gas-leak concern is exactly the judgment this actor must never
  let auto-commit; both are always a human's call. `utilconstr.governor`'s
  `high-stakes` set enforces the same invariant independently -- two
  layers, not one, agree on this (see `utilconstr.governor` ns
  docstring).

  `:log-site-record` (utility-locate/trenching/pipe-laying-progress DATA
  LOGGING, no direct capital or safety risk) and `:order-supplies` BELOW
  the cost threshold (see `utilconstr.governor/supply-order-cost-
  threshold-usd`) ARE members of phase 3's `:auto` set -- but the
  governor's own cost-threshold/confidence-floor check can still force
  `:order-supplies` to escalate even when it's `:auto`-eligible, the same
  'phase says maybe, governor decides' layering `construction.phase`
  established for `:actuation/dispatch-alert`."
